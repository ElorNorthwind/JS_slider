# JS_slider
a simple JS + CSS slider

It needs a wrapper-div with a class of 'slide-container' and a div of a class 'slider' that goes inside of it.

The slider div can include another divs (with or without caprions, borders or whatever) or images directly.

Add a class 'autoplay' to the wrapper to enable automatic slide swinching (paused on mauseover).

Should work with any number of sliders on a page.
